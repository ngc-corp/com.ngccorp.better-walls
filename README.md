# NGC Corp. Better Walls

Currently supports cobble walls only. Additional wall variants will be added after further testing.

Introduces new wall connection shapes including T-Junctions and Cross-Junctions. The mod operates independently from vanilla assets and does not override or extend existing blocks, ensuring full compatibility.

They:

✅ Provide T-Junction wall shapes<br />
✅ Provide Cross-Junction wall shapes<br />
❌ Do NOT connect to vanilla walls<br />
❌ Do NOT extend vanilla block sets<br />
❌ Do NOT override vanilla assets

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome!

This mod focuses on expanding wall connection logic, but there is still room for improvement in several areas:

### Models & UVs

- Model geometry could be further optimized
- UV layouts may be improved for better texture consistency
- Small visual alignment tweaks are always appreciated

### Connection Rules (JSON)

- ConnectedBlockRule logic can likely be refined
- Edge cases (rare placement scenarios) might still exist
- Rule optimization and cleanup are encouraged

If you:

- Want to improve models
- Refactor JSON connection rules
- Optimize structure
- Fix edge cases
- Or suggest new wall shapes

Feel free to open a Pull Request or create an Issue.

All constructive contributions are appreciated!
