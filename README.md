## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are very welcome!

This mod focuses on expanding wall connection logic, but there is still room for improvement in several areas:

### 🎨 Models & UVs

- Model geometry could be further optimized
- UV layouts may be improved for better texture consistency
- Small visual alignment tweaks are always appreciated

### 🔧 Connection Rules (JSON)

- ConnectedBlockRule logic can likely be refined
- Edge cases (rare placement scenarios) might still exist
- Rule optimization and cleanup are encouraged

If you:

- Want to improve models
- Refactor JSON connection rules
- Optimize structure
- Fix edge cases
- Or suggest new wall shapes

Feel free to open a Pull Request or create an Issue.
